# Step Count and Weather Analysis <br>
## Project Overview <br>
My project aims to analyze the relationship between daily step counts and weather conditions. Using personal step count data from Apple HealthKit and weather information from WeatherKit or other APIs, i will investigate how different weather impact physical activity levels. <br>

## Dataset Description <br>
1. Step Count Data <br>
Source: Apple HealthKit <br>
Fields: <br>
Date
Total Steps <br>
2. Weather Data <br>
Source: OpenWeatherMap (or alternative free weather APIs) <br>
Fields: <br>
Temperature (Â°C)
Precipitation (mm)
Weather Condition (e.g., Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy) <br>
## Data Collection Process <br>
Step count data will be exported from Apple Health.
Weather data will be fetched using an API for corresponding dates and locations. <br>
## Project Plan <br>
Data Collection: <br>

Export personal step count data.
Use an API to fetch weather data for the same date range. <br>
Data Preprocessing: <br>

Clean and structure the data for analysis.
Handle missing or inconsistent values. <br>
Exploratory Data Analysis: <br>

Visualize the trends in step count and weather variables.
Identify correlations between weather conditions and physical activity. <br>
Modeling: <br>

Apply statistical methods to predict step counts based on weather data.
