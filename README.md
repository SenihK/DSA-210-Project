#Step Count and Weather Analysis <br>
Project Overview
My project aims to analyze the relationship between daily step counts and weather conditions. Using personal step count data from Apple HealthKit and weather information from WeatherKit or other APIs, i will investigate how different weather impact physical activity levels.

Dataset Description
1. Step Count Data
Source: Apple HealthKit
Fields:
Date
Total Steps
2. Weather Data
Source: OpenWeatherMap (or alternative free weather APIs)
Fields:
Temperature (Â°C)
Precipitation (mm)
Weather Condition (e.g., Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy)
Data Collection Process
Step count data will be exported from Apple Health.
Weather data will be fetched using an API for corresponding dates and locations.
Project Plan
Data Collection:

Export personal step count data.
Use an API to fetch weather data for the same date range.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and structure the data for analysis.
Handle missing or inconsistent values.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Visualize the trends in step count and weather variables.
Identify correlations between weather conditions and physical activity.
Modeling:

Apply statistical methods to predict step counts based on weather data.
