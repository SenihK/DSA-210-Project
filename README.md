#The analysis of the relation between my step count and weather data
#Motivation
In our daily lives, weather significantly influences our activities and behaviors. Physical activity, especially walking, is often dictated by external factors such as temperature, precipitation, and daylight availability. As someone interested in understanding the dynamics of personal health and environmental factors, my project seeks to explore the relationship between weather conditions and step counts.
